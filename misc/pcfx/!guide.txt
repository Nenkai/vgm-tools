PCFX RIPPING
- PCFX isos are just raw data without standard format.
  Japanese dev KouFX created fx2wav to rip and decode various PCFX games.
  We can partially use his tool to get playable files for vgmstream
- Unzip fx2wav8, and SAMPLE.LZH inside to get TXTs (commands).
- Use "MAKELST.EXE (game).TXT", this will generate a two files: 
  - .lst: list with CD offsets (ISO mode, not raw sectors)
  - .ind: list with decoding commands and file names
  * Various TXT have a "X" version (ex. LANG.TXT and LANGX.TXT), but simply create .ind with resampling commands
- Normally you would use an actual CD + CDREAD.EXE (Win98 app) + .lst to rip audio data, but we can use an iso
- Get .bin iso with separate tracks and mix them
  * On Windows you can mix them with: "copy /b track1.bin+track2.bin+track3.bin game.bin"
  * If the iso didn't have separate tracks offsets won't be correct, and must be manually adjusted in the bms
- Use "bin2iso.exe -f game.bin game.iso" to create a .iso
- Rename the .iso and the .lst to the same name
- Use !pcfx_lst.bms on either to rip audio
  * Set OFFSET_ADJUST here to compensate for missing tracks.
  * fx2wav rips with the made up ".T01" extension but I use .adpcm instead
- Use !pcfx_ind.bms on the .ind file to generate a .txth 
  * change txth to start with a "." as quickbms can't do it
  * This assumes PC-FX ADPCM but some files may use PCM.
  * Other files are videos and must be demuxed first
